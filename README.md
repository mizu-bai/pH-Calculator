# pH-Calculator 

This application is designed to calculate the pH value of a solution. It is aimed to be a user-friendly tool so that the users can escape the process of searching tables for the dissociation constant, analyzing the property of the solution, and finally calculating the pH value.

## Which Solution Types are Supported 

1. Single acid or base solution: monoprotic, diproticand, and triprotic; if an acid or base can provide or accept more than three protons, it will be dealt as triprotic acid or base;

2. Mixed solution: acid & acid, base & base, and acid & base;

3. Amphiprotic solution: amphiprotic salt, salt formed by weak acid and weak base, and amino acid;
4. Acid-base buffer solution: a solution contains a  weak acid and its salt formed with another strong base, and vice versa.

## How to Input the Parameters of a Solution

1. Users can input the parameters of a solution manually, including the dissolution constant value(s) and the concentration. For dissolution constant, both $ K_i $ and $ pK_i $ are valid. When it comes to a polyprotic solution, input the dissolution constants by order,  add space between them as separators, and it will work. For concentration $ c_i $, the unit is $ mol \cdot L^{-1} $.

2. Users also have access to the inside dissolution constant datebase. Choosing the acid or base and filling the concentration is enough. It is more satisfying to select the acid or base form a list.
