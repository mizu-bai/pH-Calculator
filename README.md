# pH-Calculator 

This application is designed to calculate the pH value of a solution. It is aimed to be a user-friendly tool so that the users can escape the process of searching tables for the dissociation constant, analyzing the property of the solution, and finally calculating the pH value.



## Update

This App's UI will be built with React Native instead of SwiftUI or Storyboard. Present works will be released as a framework so that can be load in other projects.
